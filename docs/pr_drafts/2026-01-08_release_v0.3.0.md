# Release v0.3.0

## Summary
Release v0.3.0 focuses on stabilizing the application for cloud deployment and production environments. It addresses critical issues with cross-domain authentication, logging visibility, and protocol handling.

## Changelog

### Features
- **[Backend] HTTP Request Logging**: Implemented a global middleware to log method, URL, status code, and duration for all HTTP requests, providing access visibility in production.
- **[Backend] Production Logs**: Explicitly enabled all log levels (`log`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`, `verbose`) for production environments.

### Fixes
- **[Frontend] Lobby Authentication**: Replaced legacy cookie-based `fetch` with `authFetch` (Bearer token) in Lobby and Room pages to resolve cross-domain authentication failures.
- **[Backend] Auth Protocol**: Fixed an issue where the Google Login redirect URL lacked the `https://` protocol in some cloud environments.

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` and `BACKEND_URL` are correctly set in the production environment variables.
- No database migrations are required for this release.
