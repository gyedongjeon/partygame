# Hotfix v0.2.2: Fix Production Login & Debugging

## Summary
Investigates and fixes login failures in production (Vercel/Render) by adding detailed logging to the Token Exchange flow.

## Problem
- Cloud login fails (works locally).
- Suspected Cause: Communication failure between Frontend (Vercel) and Backend (Render) during server-side `fetch`.

## Changes

### Frontend (`api/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- Added `[AuthDebug]` console logs.
- Log backend URL resolution.
- Log exact `fetch` URL.
- Log response status and error body.

## Verification
- [ ] Merge to `main`.
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel.
- [ ] Check Vercel Function Logs during login attempt.
