# Hotfix v0.2.5: Fix Frontend Authentication (Bearer Token Header)

## Summary
Fixes local and production login failures by explicitly sending the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in frontend API requests.

## Problem
- Users cannot log in (stuck on login screen or `/games` page with `401 Unauthorized` errors).
- **Cause**: The frontend relied on cookies being automatically sent, but browsers block cross-site cookies. The backend now prefers the `Authorization` header.

## Changes

### Frontend
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: Updated `checkAuth` to read `auth_token` from cookie and send it in the `Authorization` header.
- **`src/components/Menu.tsx`**: Updated all fetch calls (profile GET, logout POST, profile PATCH) to include `Authorization` header. Also clears cookies locally on logout.

### Backend
- (No changes in this hotfix)

## Verification
- [x] Verified locally: Login flow redirects to `/games` correctly.
- [ ] Deploy to Production (Vercel).
- [ ] Verify Production login.
