# Hotfix v0.1.2

## Summary
Fixes persistent CORS issues by implementing a robust origin check that handles trailing slashes in `FRONTEND_URL`.

## Changes
- **Backend**: Updated `main.ts` to:
  - Explicitly allow `http://localhost:3000`.
  - Strip trailing slashes from `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable before checking matches.
  - Use a dynamic callback for the `origin` check.
  - Added explicit types to CORS callback to fix lint errors.
- **Cookies**: Configured `SameSite=None; Secure` for `access_token` in production to allow cross-site requests.
- **Versioning**: Bumped to `0.1.2`.

## Testing
- [x] Verified CORS logic handles clean URLs and URLs with trailing slashes.
