# Hotfix v0.3.1

## Summary
Fixes issues with case-insensitive room codes and improves frontend error handling for room joining.

## Technical Changes
- **Backend (`LobbyGateway`)**: Automatically converts all incoming `roomId` parameters to uppercase before processing. This ensures `abc123` matches `ABC123`.
- **Frontend (`RoomPage`)**: Fixed a bug where the client key `response.event` was checked instead of `response.type`, causing errors (like "Room not found") to be ignored and resulting in an infinite loading state.
- **Versioning**: Bumped backend and frontend versions to `0.3.1`.

## Test Report
- [x] Manual Verification: Verified backend build. Frontend logic reviewed to match backend response structure.
