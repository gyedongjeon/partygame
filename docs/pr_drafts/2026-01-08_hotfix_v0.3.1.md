# Hotfix v0.3.1

## Summary
Fixes an issue where users could not join rooms if they entered the room code in lowercase.

## Technical Changes
- **Backend**: `LobbyGateway` now automatically converts all incoming `roomId` parameters to uppercase before processing them. This ensures matches against the uppercase room IDs stored in `LobbyService`.
- **Versioning**: Bumped backend and frontend versions to `0.3.1`.

## Test Report
- [x] Manual Verification: Verified that `npm run build` passes on the backend.
