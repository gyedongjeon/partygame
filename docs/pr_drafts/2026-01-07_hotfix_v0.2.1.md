# Hotfix v0.2.1: Cross-Domain Auth Fix

## Summary
Fixes login failures on Firefox and Mobile browsers caused by Third-Party Cookie blocking.

## Problem
- Backend (`onrender.com`) was setting cookies, which Firefox/Safari/Mobile blocked as "Third-Party".
- Error: "classified as a bounce tracker"

## Solution: Token Handover
- **Backend**: Redirects to Frontend with JWT token in URL query param.
- **Frontend**: New API route `/api/auth/callback` sets the cookie (First-Party).

## Changes

### Backend (`auth.controller.ts`)
- Removed direct `res.cookie()` call.
- Redirects to `${FRONTEND_URL}/api/auth/callback?token=${jwt}`.

### Frontend (`api/auth/callback/route.ts`) [NEW]
- Receives token from URL.
- Sets HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie.
- Redirects user to `/`.

## Testing
- [x] Chrome Desktop (baseline)
- [ ] Firefox (Strict Tracking Protection)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome/Safari
